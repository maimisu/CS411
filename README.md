# Analysis of Algorithms: Ford-Fulkerson

This C++ program implements the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to calculate the maximum flow of the graph.

To test the program for different edges and weights, please change the driver function part of the program.
I have added another graph that is commented out (line 86-99), incase you'd like to test it with different weights.
